# ðŸ¦Š Fox RPG - Godot Learning Project

This is a small-scoped Godot 4.3 project, featuring a top-down RPG-like game, where you play as a little fox avoiding damage from bats and destroying grass. Sounds dangerous! 

The tutorial I followed is an amazing ~8h course made by **Hearbeast**, which you can check out [on his YouTube channel](/https://youtu.be/mAbG8Oi-SvQ?list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a).
